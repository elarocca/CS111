We have successfully implemented a shell reader that works for both test-p-ok and gives errors for test-p-bad

Some contraints:

	1. may not have checked for all errors or correct behaviors
	2. if there are two commands, the first command is correct but second is not
		shell outputs the first and gives error to the second. Yet, we parsed everything
		together so if one command is errorneous, the whole input will output an error
	3. There may be some memory leaks
	4. May be more efficient
